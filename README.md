## Notes For Reviewers
I had a lot of trouble trying to hook everything up to GCP. I decided to make the switch to AWS after a long struggle. After the digging that I had to do during that, the transition to AWS was a breeze.

I kept the info that is being pulled back to a minimum. My API simply pulls back GeoIP info.

Terraform is incredibly powerful. I had never heard of it before speaking with you guys. But it seems fairly intuitive. The main struggle for me was just related to the cloud platform I started with.

No matter how this goes, I'm looking forward to exploring Terraform more.
